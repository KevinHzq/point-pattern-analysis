abstract = {The paper discusses the objectives of spatial point pattern analysis, with particular reference to the distinction between mapped and sampled data. For the former case, available models are reviewed briefly, the role of preliminary testing is discussed and a procedure for fitting a parametric model is outlined. A simulation study of several tests of spatial randomness is intended to provide some insight into the suitability for model-fitting of various summary descriptions of a mapped pattern. Two examples illustrate the use of statistical techniques. Some problem areas which merit further investigation are identified.},

abstract = {Written by a prominent statistician and author, the first edition of this bestseller broke new ground in the then emerging subject of spatial statistics with its coverage of spatial point patterns. Retaining all the material from the second edition and adding substantial new material, Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns, Third Edition presents models and statistical methods for analyzing spatially referenced point process data. Reflected in the title, this third edition now covers spatio-temporal point patterns. It explores the methodological developments from the last decade along with diverse applications that use spatio-temporally indexed data. Practical examples illustrate how the methods are applied to analyze spatial data in the life sciences. This edition also incorporates the use of R through several packages dedicated to the analysis of spatial point process data. Sample R code and data sets are available on the author's website.},

@article{Caplan2020,
abstract = {Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) is a spatial analysis technique used to diagnose environmental conditions that lead to hazardous outcomes. Originally developed for applications to violent crime analysis, RTM is utilized here to analyze Dr. John Snow's data from the 1854 cholera outbreak in London to demonstrate its potential value to contemporary epidemiological investigations. Dr. Snow saved countless lives when he traced the source of the cholera outbreak to a specific water pump through inductive reasoning, which he communicated through maps and spatial evidence. His methods have since inspired several fields of scientific inquiry. Informed by the extant research on RTM, we speculated that it could have helped test Dr. Snow's hypothesis about cholera and empirically identified the sole source of contaminated well water. We learned that it could and, although it was not available to Dr. Snow in the 1800s, we discuss RTM's implications for present-day research and practice as it relates to the analysis, prevention and treatment of cholera and other public health threats around the world.},
